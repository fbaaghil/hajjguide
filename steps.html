					<p>
						Before starting Hajj, a pilgrim first must be in Ihram. Ihram is a sacred state a pilgrim must enter.
						In this state, one is not allowed to hurt anyone or anything, physically nor verbally. (Even something as small
						as spider). They're are not allowed to cut their hair, nails, nor where or use any scented soaps or perfume.
						For men, they must wear two pieces of unstitched cloth; and for women they may wear whatever covered clothing
						they would like. Then they must travel to Mina, and engage in worship the whole day.

						<h1>9th Day</h1>
					</header>

					<p> On the 9th Day, a pilgrim must pray the morning obligatory prayer, Fajr. Then they must travel to
						Arafat. Arafat is where the Mount of Mercy is located or Jabal al-Rahmah, where Abraham was
						commanded to sacrfice his son, Ishmael. Abraham and Ishmael did not hesitate, and before Abraham sacrificed his son,
						God sent down a sheep for Abraham to sacrifice instead.
						Pilgrims might either pray or engage in worship by standing in the plains of Arafat or on the Mount of Mercy.
						The afteroon, Dhur, and late afternoon, Asr prayer is prayed here.
						Then pilgrims must leave to Muzdalifah anytime after sunset.
						At Muzdalifah, pilgrims pray the after sunset, Magrib, and night prayer, Isha.
						Pilgrims collect 70 pebbles from here.

						<h1>10th Day</h1>
					</header>
					<p> Pilgrims pray the before sunset prayer, Fajr, and return back to Mina
						right before sunrise. Then pilgrims must travel to Jamarat, a place where there area
						 three huge pillars. These three huge pillars represent Satan where he tried
						 to persuade Abraham, his wife, Hajar, and their son, Ishmael against following
						 God's command to sacrifice Ishmael. Pilgrims must throw 7 stones at each of these pillars, rejecting
						 Satan's persuasions.
						 For the 10th day, pilgrims only throw 7 stones at the biggest pillar where thrice, Abraham was
						 attempted to persuade to not follow God's command by Satan.

						 Then pilgrims either pay or sacrifice an animal, Udhiya. A portion of the meat that is sacrficed is
						 given to the poor.
						 Then pilgrims, for men, shave the hair, and for women, cut a piece a piece of their hair.
						 This marks the end of the Ihram, where pilgrims now shower, able to use scented perfumes and change their clothes.
						 However, pilgrims are still not allowed to enagage in intercourse.
						 Then pilgrims travel to Makkah, perform Tawaaf, praising God while going around
						 the Kabah seven times. Drink the holy water ZamZam. Perform Sa'ee, 7 times. Sa'ee is in commemoration
						 of when Hajar and Ishamel was left by her husband, Abraham in the middle of the desert by
						 God's command with some food and water supplies. When the food and water supplies ran out, she ran between
						 Safa and Marwa, two hills, asking God for help. God made the ground where her baby kicked, to spring
						 out water, ZamZam.
						 Then pilgrims return back to Mina.
